# Inventory-Calculator
Inventory calculator counts the amount of any small items like bolts, screws, nails, rivets, and any other type of small hardware based on their weight. Imagine having to count 2,000 of these types of hardware one by one, and there are shelves full of groups of these items to do inventory.

Instructions
Control quantity: If single item is too small that a scale canâ€™t read its weight, add more than one of the same items to the scale, and add the obtained weight exactly as it appears on the screen of the scale.

Single Weight is optional only if all the other inputs are filled. However, if a single item gives a reading of its weight on a scale, then the mass weight and single weight inputs may be filled without control quantity and control qty weight inputs, and the weight calculator will output the amount of items
